# Water Potability & Water pH Categories Prediction
## Problem Statement
Water is used to carry out activities such as dehydration, cleaning and food production. Well-mainteained water resources can boost countriesâ€™ economic growth and can reduce poverty rate. In contrast, contaminated water are often associated with the transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, and hepatitis A. Lack of clean water resources could put both the patients and health care workers at additional risk of being infected by viruses.

## Main Objectives
* Predict if each water sample is potable or not potable. (Binary Classification)
* Predict the pH values of each water sample, which can be acidic, normal pH level for surface water system, or alkaline. (Multiclass Classification)

## Dataset Descriptions

* ph: pH of 1. water (0 to 14).
* Hardness: Capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L.
* Solids: Total dissolved solids in ppm.
* Chloramines: Amount of Chloramines in ppm.
* Sulfate: Amount of Sulfates dissolved in mg/L.
* Conductivity: Electrical conductivity of water in Î¼S/cm.
* Organic_carbon: Amount of organic carbon in ppm.
* Trihalomethanes: Amount of Trihalomethanes in Î¼g/L.
* Turbidity: Measure of light emiting property of water in NTU.
* Potability: Indicates if water is safe for human consumption. Potable = 1 and Not potable = 0
